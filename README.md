# Front End Developer Course
---
## Project Overview:

For this project I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use using CSS flexbox, responsive images, semantic markup, and media queries. I also added a service worker to provide off-line first data to the web app.

### How to run this app

1. Clone the repository.
2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 
3. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
4. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
* If you want to use a different port number, you must update the port number in dbhelper.js on line 11.
* If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
